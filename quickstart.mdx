## Important: MQTT Broker Setup

Before you can start sending data, you need to set up an MQTT broker on your Raspberry Pi or Debian system. Here's how to install and configure it:

### 1. Install Mosquitto MQTT Broker

```bash
# Update package list
sudo apt-get update

# Install Mosquitto broker and client tools
sudo apt-get install -y mosquitto mosquitto-clients
```

### 2. Start and Enable the MQTT Broker

```bash
# Start the Mosquitto service
sudo systemctl start mosquitto

# Enable Mosquitto to start on boot
sudo systemctl enable mosquitto

# Check the service status
sudo systemctl status mosquitto
```

### 3. Verify Installation

Open two terminal windows and test the MQTT broker:

In the first terminal, subscribe to a test topic:
```bash
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -t "test" -v
```

In the second terminal, publish a test message:
```bash
mosquitto_pub -h localhost -t "test" -m "Hello MQTT"
```

You should see the message appear in your subscriber terminal.

### 4. Configure Mosquitto (Optional)

Edit the Mosquitto configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
```

Add these basic settings:
```conf
# Allow anonymous connections (for testing)
allow_anonymous true

# Listen on all interfaces
listener 1883
```

Restart Mosquitto to apply changes:
```bash
sudo systemctl restart mosquitto
```

## Data Format

Send your sensor readings in the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "greenhouseId": "507f1f77bcf86cd799439011",
  "temperature": 25.5,
  "humidity": 60,
  "ph": 1,
  "soilMoisture": 40
}
```

### Data Fields
- `temperature`: Temperature reading in Celsius (Â°C)
- `humidity`: Humidity percentage (%)
- `ph`: pH value (0-14 scale)
- `soilMoisture`: Soil moisture percentage (%)
- `greenhouseId`: Your unique greenhouse identifier

## MQTT Topic Structure

Use the following topic format for publishing your data:

```
greenhouse/${greenhouseId}/data
```

Example:
```
greenhouse/507f1f77bcf86cd799439011/data
```

## Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your `.env` file:

```env
GREENHOUSE_ID=your_greenhouse_id
MQTT_BROKER=localhost
MQTT_PORT=1883
```
